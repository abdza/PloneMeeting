Installation of PloneMeeting
---------------------------
PloneMeeting allows to manage agendas and decisions of any decision-making
organism (a city counsil, a board of ministers, a board of
directors, the general assembly of a non-profit organisation or NGO...)

Caution: at present, we recommand to install PloneMeeting on Linux or Unix
machines. Installation under Windows hasn't been tested extensively.

2 installation methods are mentionned: 
- manual installation: the old way
- automatic installation: best way to manage multiple installations (development/test/production) -> recommended

# AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION USING BUILDOUT                                        #
################################################################################

1) Follow the install doc:

- in english : http://svn.communesplone.org/svn/communesplone/PloneMeeting/buildout/pm255_trunk/INSTALL.txt
- in french : http://svn.communesplone.org/svn/communesplone/PloneMeeting/buildout/pm255_trunk/INSTALL_fr.txt

During this installation, modify the file buildout.cfg to use a stable version (last one in http://svn.communesplone.org/svn/communesplone/PloneMeeting/tags/...

################################################################################

1) Install Plone 2.5.5
----------------------
PloneMeeting runs on Plone 2.5.x. The easiest way to install this Plone is to
download the Plone unified installer at
http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/2.5.5

2) Install the Appy framework
-----------------------------
PloneMeeting also depends on the Appy Framework (see http://appyframework.org).

Download it (version >= 0.4.0) at http://launchpad.net/appy.

Suppose you have installed Plone with the unified installer at /opt/Plone-2.5.5.
You can unzip appy.0.4.0.zip (or newer) in /opt/Plone-2.5.5/Python-2.4.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/

This framework contains appy.pod, used by PloneMeeting for generating documents
(PDF, RTF, ODT, etc). If you want to generate documents in another format than
OpenDocument (ODT), you will need to run OpenOffice in server mode.

3) Create a Zope instance
-------------------------
A Zope instance is a web server that will run PloneMeeting.
Creating a Zope instance is explained at http://appyframework.org/gen.html.
I suppose that the Zope instance you have been created is in folder <zopeInstance>.

4) Install PloneMeeting
----------------------
a) Unzip hubsessions.zip found at http://launchpad.net/hubsessions in 
   <zopeInstance>/Products
b) Alternatively, you can also download it from the SVN (for developers):
   cd <zopeInstance>/Products
   svn co http://svn.communesplone.org/svn/communesplone/PloneMeeting/trunk PloneMeeting

Note: you MUST have PloneMeeting installed in the 'Products' subfolder of
your Zope instance. Else, initializing PloneMeeting through an extension profile (which
is recommanded but not mandatory) will not work.

# COMMON PART : adding a plone site and configure it                           #
################################################################################

1) Create a Plone site with a "PloneMeeting" extension profile
--------------------------------------------------------------
We recommand to initialize PloneMeeting through an extension profile that is
parameterized with correct data. For inspiration, we have created such a profile, named
"PloneMeeting / Default". So here's what we propose:
    - create a Plone site with this extension profile
    - test and explore PloneMeeting with those settings
    - once you are comfortable with PloneMeeting concepts and if you want to go further,
      see how this extension profile was built (in
      <zopeInstance>/Products/PloneMeeting/profiles/default; the file import_data.py is the
      most important file; classes used to describe data defined in import_data.py are
      located in <zopeInstance>/Products/PloneMeeting/profiles/__init__.py) and try to create
      your own profile in a new Plone Product.

Here are the instructions for importing and using the "PloneMeeting / Default" profile.

a) Restart your Zope instance, and create a PloneSite (in the ZMI at <zopeInstanceUrl>/manage,
   in the Zope root folder, select "Plone site" in the dropdown on the right, and, in the
   "Extension profiles", select "PloneMeeting / Default". The title you specify for your Plone
   site will be used in the subjects of the e-mail notifications that PloneMeeting may send.

   This profile creates 2 fictitious "meeting configurations", that define 2 kinds of
   meetings ("PloneGov assembly" and "PloneMeeting assembly") that are parameterized
   differently in order to show you some customization possibilities of PloneMeeting.

b) Connect to your Plone site and log in as Zope admin. You will see that PloneMeeting has added
   2 more tabs: "plonegov assembly" and "plonemeeting assembly". Go to the Plone "site setup".
   In the section "Add-On Product Configuration", there is a new configlet named
   "PloneMeeting". If you click on it, you will access the PloneMeeting administration interface,
   that is fully documented (in english and in french). Once you've read carefully what is
   related to PloneMeeting groups and roles, you can read the remaining of this file.

c) Ah, you've already read everything ? Right! The extension profile has created
   2 PloneMeeting groups:
   - vendors
   - developers

   and 5 users:
   - pmManager
   - pmCreator1
   - pmReviewer1
   - pmCreator2
   - pmReviewer2

   They have the same password: "meeting" (without the double quotes).

   * pmManager has the global role "MeetingManager" and is creator, reviewer and observer
     in the group "developers"
   * pmCreator1 is creator in group "developers"
   * pmReviewer1 is reviewer and observer in group "developers"
   * pmCreator2 is creator in group "vendors"
   * pmReviewer2 is reviewer and observer in group "vendors".

d) In order to have everything working fine, make the following adjustments to your Plone site:
   - If you want to test the e-mail notifications, be sure to configure correctly the Plone
     MailHost (in "Site setup->Mail Settings"); in "Site setup->Portal Settings", set correct
     values for the fields "Site 'From' name" and "Site 'From' address"; in "Site Setup->Users
     and Groups administration", define emails under your control for all users created by
     the profile.
   - If you want to test document generation, read carefully the section entitled
     "OpenOffice configuration" in the "PloneMeeting" configlet, and, within each meeting
     configuration, check the section entitled "Document generation".

e) Now you may try to log in as any of those users; the PloneMeeting interface will show or hide
   some elements according to the permissions your user has; you will also only see items and
   meetings that you are allowed to view. Try to create items, meetings, associate items to meetings,
   generate documents from them, etc. Play with the workflows (propose, validate items; publish,
   decide meetings, etc). You will learn a lot about the PloneMeeting possibilities
   by consulting the fully-documented administration pages in the PloneMeeting configlet.
